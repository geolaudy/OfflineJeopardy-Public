# Session handoff

Read this first in a new session, then `PROGRESS.md` (top section) and `FEATURE_MATRIX.md` → "User feedback round 4".

## Current state (updated 2026-10-15, session 7)

- Branch: `main`, pushed to `origin/main`. Release **v0.10.0** tagged (GitHub Actions builds the public release; see PROGRESS.md for the verified release record).
- `package.json` version: **0.10.0**. Tests at the last full run: **Vitest 226/226, Playwright 38/38**.
- Local artifacts (include the owner's sounds — personal use only, do not upload): `release/OfflineJeopardy-Setup-0.10.0.exe`, `release/OfflineJeopardy-Portable-0.10.0.exe`, `release/win-unpacked/` (verify-dist **17/17**, incl. "serves the Jeopardy!/Buzzinga sounds — 9 cues").
- Round-5 requirements: USER_FEEDBACK.md "Round 5" (R5-2 … R5-20), IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN milestone 19, FEATURE_MATRIX "User feedback round 5", decisions D55–D63.

## Round 5 status (all milestones done and tested)

| G — AI (agent) | R5-11 Gemini + provider registry | Done, tested with a fake Gemini API only (K31) |

## Owner's assets (important)

- `new_sfx/` holds the owner's sound files + a clue background image. **Git-ignored. Never commit or publish them.**
- `npm run build:electron` copies the audio into `build/private-sfx/` (git-ignored) → a *local* `npm run dist` ships them in `resources/soundpacks/buzzinga` (personal use only). The GitHub workflow has no `new_sfx`, so public releases contain none; `verify-dist` fails in CI if any are present.
- Dev server: `npm run dev:server` passes `--sfx=new_sfx`.
- The clue background is recreated in CSS (the JPEG is not used); TV fonts are OFL look-alikes (licensed fonts plug in via Windows install or `<data>/fonts/clue|category|value.*`).

## Builds / release workflow

Unchanged from session 5: `npm run dist` + `npm run dist:verify`; release = bump version + CHANGELOG section → commit/push → `git tag -a vX.Y.Z` → push tag → GitHub Actions builds, verifies and publishes. No `gh` CLI; verify via the GitHub API with the stored git credential.

## Gotchas

- Do not leave a shell inside `test-results/` (Playwright hangs on Windows).
- Python edit scripts: write with `newline=''`; **never put regexes with `\b` in a heredoc** — write the script to a file (a heredoc turned `\b` into backspace characters once).
- Stopping a Playwright run can leave its test server on port 3210; check `netstat -ano | grep 3210` before re-running.

## After v0.8.0 (same session)

- Play-testing: engine fuzzer (`tests/unit/playtest.fuzz.test.ts`, `FUZZ_GAMES=3000` locally), browser play-test (`tests/e2e/playtest.spec.ts`), soak test (`tests/integration/soak.test.ts`). Fixed stuck states when removing players mid-game, Final with nobody eligible, input-bridge flood limit, small-screen overflows.
- Features: practice games advance by themselves, per-sound volume, leaderboard minimums, local/OpenAI-compatible AI provider, Create a board with AI, head to head on the TV, migration v5 ("Final Wager" → "Final Jeopardy!").
- E2E specs must clean up what they leave behind (lobbies, boards, settings) — game.spec restores "trust localhost" in afterEach.

## Next recommended tasks

1. Owner on real devices: try Gemini with a real key (K31); team lobby drag-and-drop and the new clue screen on the real iPad (K32, K34); scan the smaller join QR from the sofa (K33); listen to the victory fanfare and the Final swipes on the TV.
2. If the owner wants the recordings in the GitHub download: not possible without redistribution rights — keep the "Sounds folder next to the exe" route (K28).
3. Earlier open items: Joy-Con vibration on hardware (K25), local AI with a real Ollama (K30), workspaces (O6), plugin system (O13).
